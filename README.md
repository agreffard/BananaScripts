# BananaScripts
A bunch of experimental code and time saver scripts.

Because bananana, bananana, banana scripts, hm!

## tools: time saver scripts

### [renameImagesWithDate.py](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/blob/master/tools/renameImagesWithDate.py)

Rename all images in current directory by adding the date before the original file name.

### [pytumblr/](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/tree/master/tools/pytumblr)

Automatically upload images to my [365 photo project](https://agreffard-nyc.tumblr.com/) using the [PyTumblr API](https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr).

## groovyscripts: experimantal projects

### [timeRemap.py](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/blob/master/groovyscripts/timeRemap.py)
Experimental code for time remap from webcam using OpenCV.

Inspired from [Anamorphose temporelle - Adrien M & Claire B](https://vimeo.com/7878518)

### [550stripes/](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/tree/master/groovyscripts/550stripes)

Tools to build the final image of my 365 project, representing all 550 images in one.

550 stripes = 550 colors = 550 images = 550 pictures from July 2016 to December 2017.

Final result: https://agreffard.github.io/thecolorsofnewyorkcity/

- `buildColorsData.py`: Builds a json file containing data for each stripe (image, text, main color).
- `buildThumbnails.py`: Builds a thumbnail for each image.
- `buildFinalImage.py`: Builds the final image containing all 550 images as color stripes.

See my other repository [thecolorsofnewyorkcity](https://github.com/agreffard/thecolorsofnewyorkcity).

### [okgo.py](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/blob/master/groovyscripts/okgo.py)

Extremely experimental project.

First attempt at recreating the [OK GO - WTF?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zJw9varYE) effet without green screen (using only background extraction).

Interesting first result, to be continued.

### [discodiscoyeahyeahyeah.py](https://github.com/agreffard/BananaScripts/blob/master/groovyscripts/discodiscoyeahyeahyeah.py)

Extremely experimental project. 70's inspired.

Generates moving fireworks of multiple series of disco balls of random colors.

Just for fun.
